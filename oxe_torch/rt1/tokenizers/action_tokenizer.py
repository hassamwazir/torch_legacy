Please define action space using gym.spaces.Dict.

As an example, if an action is:
done = [0, 1] # this is one hot vector.
xyz = [0.9, 0.8, -0.3]
rpy = [-0.1, 0.2, .6]
grasp = 0.9

then action space will look like
action_space = gym.spaces.Dict(
    {
        'done': gym.spaces.Discrete(2),
        'xyz': gym.spaces.Box(low= -1.0, high= 1.0, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32),
        'rpy': gym.spaces.Box(low= -np.pi / 2  , high= np.pi / 2, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32),
        'grasp': gym.spaces.Box(low= 0  , high= 1.0, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32)
    }
)
or 
action_space = gym.spaces.Dict(
            OrderedDict([
                ('done', gym.spaces.Discrete(2)), 
                ('xyz', gym.spaces.Box(low= -1.0, high= 1.0, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32)),
                ('rpy', gym.spaces.Box(low= -np.pi / 2., high= np.pi / 2., shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32)),
                ('grasp', gym.spaces.Box(low= 0  , high= 1.0, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32))
                ])
        )
Please use OrderedDict if you want gym.spaces.Dict to keep order of actions.

This action_space is just information about each action.
These information are very convenient when interpreting, examining, cliping, and processing the action
because the action is dictionary with key names which are the same as the action_space.

action value will be look like
action = {
    'done': 1,
    'xyz': [0.9, 0.8, -0.3],
    'rpy': [-0.1, 0.2, .6],
    'grasp': [0.9]
}
Note that values are int and numpy 1-d arrays.
